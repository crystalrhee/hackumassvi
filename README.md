<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25557896/46908646-c1499580-cef3-11e8-93c7-9a2243e19933.png"/>
  
Created for HackUMass VI, this project uses Leap Motion to detect gestures. Moving the ring or pinkie finger to the thumb starts a mode. These modes include a music player mode and a morse code mode. In the music mode, the gestures are linked to media commands and can be used to control any music player. In the morse code mode, the swipe down gesture is a dot and the system outputs the message upon changing the mode.

## FAQ:japanese_ogre: :pouting_cat: :heart_eyes_cat:
- How can I learn more about Leap Motion?  
The official website for Leap Motion has a great start-up guide for new users, however their sample code for the Python SDK may have some errors. If one finds errors, they can reference our code above.  
https://developer.leapmotion.com/#101  
- Are there similar music-related Leap Motion technologies?  
Composers may be interested in http://lyravr.com/ which allows users to compose music through interactive blocks
- Will this work on any OS?
It has been tested the most on OSX, but it will run on Windows as well. Feel free to submit issues here.
