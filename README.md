## FAQ :japanese_ogre: :pouting_cat: :heart_eyes_cat:
- How can I learn more about Leap Motion?  
The official website for Leap Motion has a great start-up guide for new users, however their sample code for the Python SDK may have some errors. If one finds errors, they can reference our code above.  
https://developer.leapmotion.com/#101  
- Are there similar music-related Leap Motion technologies?  
Composers may be interested in http://lyravr.com/ which allows users to compose music through interactive blocks
- Will this work on any OS?
It has been tested the most on OSX, but it will run on Windows as well. Feel free to submit issues here.
